Note: Fuse a Sun persona at the dungeon. The lowest one you can get is probably
      Cu Sith (Requires level 10). Also, there will be a few Aiya meals coming
      up, each of them is 3000 yen, so save about 12,000 here if you can. If
      you don't clear today, you'll still have 4/29 to come again. And lastly,
      try to level up to 17, we'd need to fuse a persona for the next dungeon.

Note: Last day to clear Castle or game over. If not cleared yet, do it today,
      otherwise visit Aiya; reset if the Aiya meal does not increase Courage.
      The Aiya meal on rainy day is insanely expensive: 3000 yen. However, it
      randomly increase 3 out of four status parameters (except Expression)
      in one time slot and hence is a very nice way to boost your stats. In the
      beginning we need some Courage to initiate Moon; that is the reson of
      resetting.

Note: Justice link is automatically started today. In future you can advance
      this link by talking to Nanako in the sitting room. Notice that Justice
      link is a bit weird: first, it heavily relies on Expression, you will be
      told if your Expression is not strong enough to go on; second, due to the
      story this link does not go on till the end of the playable calendar. Try
      to stick to this link's schedule in this guide more strictly.

Note: Hermit is a special social link. You don't rank up by meeting, instead,
      you rank up by fulfilling the people's wishes written on the wooden
      plaque. These wishes are incorporated into the 50 in-game quests. Fox
      will also join force from now on and provide SP recovery to you in the
      dungeon for a sky-high price. At rank 1, it's 60 yen per SP; at rank 10,
      it'd be only 15 yen.

      Hierophant link also has some requirement on Expression in order to
      advance, and it also ends earlier than other social links. If you are
      following this guide, try harder to stick to Hierophant--it has less

      not, you have until 5/15 for a second attempt. Moon (Ai) is at the front
      door of the school, next to the shoe cabinets.

You'll also get the first quest from Fox today. If you are lost, check
http://persona4.wikidot.com/quests for the quest guide.

      A bit on making lunch: sometimes Nanako tells you that she has done some
      shopping. That means you'd find some ingredients in the fridge and you
      can decide to make lunch. Making lunch takes up the evening time. Every
      time the MC makes a new dish and you'd be asked to choose one out of
      three recipes. If you pick a right one, you'd usually get a dish for
      tomorrow and three baits.

      The next day, during lunch break, you can decide whom to invite for
      lunch. Having lunch with a social link contributes points, too. Having
      matching persona will help. Becauser there wouldn't be any chance for
      you to sort out your persona before the lunch invitation, make sure you
      have it by the end of today.

Note: Hanged man link is available on non-rainy Mon through Fri. It may sound

      available as you think. The link will be in front of the alcohol store,
      which is a bit up north passed the shrine.

      You may use the optional night time to fish, especially get a goldfish,
      it'd be required by one of Fox's quests later. Another type of
      recommended fish would be Amber Seemer; for four of these you can get a
      Bless Hands accessory in July. This accessory add 50% potency to HP
      recovery spells of the wearer.

Here the Moon social link will split. Depends on what you pick at the last
question, the questions in rank 7 to 10 will change. So, remember what you
have picked here.

If you want her to be lover, pick:
ANY > ANY > 2 > 2 [2=LOVER]. We will call this "Lover route".

If you want her to be friend, pick:
ANY > ANY > 1 OR ANY > ANY > 2 > 1, then she'll be your temporary lover, but
at the end it'd end up with friends. We'll call this "Friend route".

Note: Inititation of Fortune involves a bit more work. First, you'd need maxed

      and get a card from him. Go to the 1/F of the school, and hand the card
      to Naoto on any Mon, Tue, Wed, or Sat. Then the link will be initiated.

      Fortune link is on every Mon, Tue, Thu, and Sat. When its rank reaches a
      certain level, it'd also be on Wed. The link is standing on the 1/F of
      the school on a school day, and at the floodplain if it's a holiday or
      weekend.

This rank is also another important split:

For the first choice, pick 3.
For the second choice, if you choose to protect Fortune, it'd lead to one more
 choice. However, if you choose to fight back or escape with Fortune, it will
 only lead to friendship.
For the third choice, which will only happen if you have protected Fortune, the
 first choice would get to love relationship, the second choice leads to
 friendship.
